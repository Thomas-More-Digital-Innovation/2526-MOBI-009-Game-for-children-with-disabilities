# 2526-MOBI-009-Game-for-children-with-disabilities
What is the project about?
A VR application which uses mixed reality was created, specifically for children with motor disabilities.
The App scans the environment and places a Car track scaled according to the surface of any nearby table
A controller was configured to start and stop the car going around the car track to make the game compatible with an adapatability controller.
The App allows for passthrough so that surrounding can be seen inside the VR
